Status
-------------------------------

This project is still in early development stage. It is not ready to use, not even experimentally.

There are dozens of pages of design notes, but the plan still lacks coherence, so is unpublished.

How to use
-------------------------------

The compiler is written in Rust. You can run it using:

    cargo run

This compiles to native code, with WebAssembly to be added later (#34).
