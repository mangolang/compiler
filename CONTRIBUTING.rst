Contributing
===============================

Contributions are very welcome!

There are many ways to contribute:

* Reporting bugs (issues_)
* Suggesting features (issues_)
* Fixing bugs
* Implementing features
* Refactoring code
* Adding tests
* Writing documentation / examples
* Reviewing a `pull request`_
* Telling a friend :)

Licensing
-------------------------------

* Be aware that you are making your contributions available under `Apache License 2.0`_.
* Do not include copyright, author or change date in source files.

Code conventions
-------------------------------

* Try to follow the `Kotlin coding convention`_.
* Some of these and some other conventions are enforced by Detekt_ and (config_) KtLint_ as part of gradle build.
* Try to include tests for any non-trivial code.
* Assertion-style checks are encouraged, but use ``require``.

Git
-------------------------------

All changes must be done through pull requests. Automated tests and style checks are automatically ran for pull requests.

* Try not to make commits too large.
* The title of the commit message should summarize why the change is made.
* The title of the commit message should be imperative (be able to follow 'this change will...').
* If the commit message contains body, it should be separated from the title by a newline.
* Titles should start with a capital, omit the period, and be at most 72 characters (preferably 50).
